# AGVN Main

The main place to store the display-server logic. For other things like experimental stuff, admin stuff, supporting stuff, use other repos.

- should be mostly for the main server and microservices, as well as the graphical frontend

SHOULD TRY TO GET A BACKEND RESTFUL API for GCLOUD RUN. Can just use the builtin firebase api or something. Really only need key-value stores.
